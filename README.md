# Fandango-Project
This project explores whether Fandango inflates movie ratings compared to Rotten Tomatoes. Using data analysis and visualization, I compared ratings and found that Fandango consistently displays higher ratings than actual audience scores, raising concerns about rating transparency. Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
